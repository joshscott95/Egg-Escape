# Egg-Escape
JavaScript 2D game 

// Hello this is my JavaScript web based 2d project called Egg-Escape that I learned how to make from FreeCodeCamp.org

// the purpose of the game is to use the player character to collide with egg classes and push them to the top margin of the screen thus scoring points

// a lose condition for this game is if too many larva (larva hatches from the eggs after a set time) get eaten by the enemy toads

// scoring points can be done in two ways: 
  1) pushing eggs to the top margin of the screen 
  2) pushing larva safely to the top margin of the screen
// youll know if they have been secured safely because there will be a firefly partical colored yellow that will spiral upward indicating a safe arrival
// youll know if your larva have been eaten by toads if a blue spark particle is released upon colliding with an enemy toad shortly after disappearing

// the game has an added debug feature which can be toggled on/off using 'D' and it shows:
  * hit-box radii
  * mouse pointer direction/drag
  * hatch timer for eggs

//if you get stuck or lose just press 'R'!



// Have fun!
